## Description

GGEMS is an advanced Monte Carlo simulation platform using CPU and GPU architecture targeting medical applications (imaging and particle therapy). This code is based on the well-validated Geant4 physics model and capable to be executed in both CPU and GPU devices using the OpenCL library.

Features:
* Photon particle tracking
* Multithreaded CPU (Intel, AMD not tested)
* GPU (NVIDIA, Intel, AMD not tested)
* Multi devices (GPUs+CPU) approach
* Single or double float precision for dosimetry application
* External X-ray source
* Navigation in simple box volume or voxelized volume
* Flat or curved detector for CBCT/CT application

## Requirements

GGEMS is a multiplatform application using OpenCL.

OpenCL v1.2 has to be installed on your system.

Supported operating system:

* Windows
* Linux

Tested compilers:

* gcc 7/8/9 on Linux
